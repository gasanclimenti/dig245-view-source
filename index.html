<h1>DIG 245 View Source</h1>

<h3>How to View Source Code (on a Windows Computer):</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open up the Chrome browser.</li>
  <li>Find a web page whose source code you would like to view.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the page and select "View page source," or use the shortcut "ctrl+U".</li>
  <li>A new tab with the code should appear!</li>
</ol>

<h3>What to do with Dev Tools:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The "Elements" section allows you to edit the CSS and HTML code and see how the updates impact your page in real time.</li>
  <li>You can also scroll to or hide different elements by right-clicking specific lines of code to help you easily edit your page.</li>
  <li>In the "Console" section, you can check and edit Javascript or CSS for the webpage, or even find a secret message!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metaphor</h3>
  <p>Looking at the code is like pulling back a curtain. On a presentation-ready stage, much like a webpage, everything seems to run smoothly and seamlessly.
     Behind the scenes is, to an untrained eye, chaos. But for those who understand the workings of HTML and other code, inspecting a webpage and revealing what's
     behind the curtain can be informative in how the production actually runs (not by magic).</p>

<h3>Secret Message</h3>

<p>First, open the
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">New York Times.</a>
  Then, right-click and select "Inspect". Next, click on the "Console" option. View the secret message!</p>

<h3>Turtles!</h3>

  console.log("In case you're wondering, the seven are loggerheads, leatherbacks, hawksbill, olive ridley, Kemp's ridely, flatback, and green sea turtles!");
